# Wind Turbine Ice Detection System

End-to-end ML pipeline for **icing risk (binary)** and **turbine operating state (multiclass)** classification.  
Built with **scikit-learn** and **XGBoost**, includes **SHAP** explainability and a **Streamlit** app for interactive exploration.  
Large datasets and trained models are intentionally excluded so the repo stays lightweight and reproducible.

##  Key Features

-  **Binary & Multiclass models**: Logistic Regression and XGBoost baselines
-  **Evaluation utilities**: metrics, confusion matrices, model comparison
-  **Explainability**: SHAP (global + local attributions)
-  **Streamlit dashboard**: quick what-if analysis and visualization
-  **Reproducible scripts**: one-command training/evaluation
-  **Data/model hygiene**: CSVs and pickled models are ignored by default
